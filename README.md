# 🏥 Hospital Management System  
### Microsoft Access | VBA | Relational Database

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a comprehensive **Hospital Management System** developed using **Microsoft Access** with embedded **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)** logic. It aims to streamline hospital operations by efficiently managing **Patients**, **Doctors**, **Appointments**, **Billing**, and **Medical Records** through an interactive, form-based user interface. The system supports real-time data entry, validations, automated workflows, and detailed reports to enhance the overall hospital administration process.
